Weather Prediction (Classification) - Machine Learning Project :
This project demonstrates a supervised machine learning classification model developed to predict weather conditions (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy) based on various environmental and meteorological parameters. It showcases my ability to work with structured data, apply end-to-end ML workflows, and deliver accurate predictions through model optimization and evaluation.

Objective
The objective of this project is to build a robust classification model that can accurately predict the type of weather using real-world weather data. This involves understanding the dataset, applying preprocessing techniques, training multiple models, and selecting the best-performing one using evaluation metrics.

Dataset Features
The dataset contains the following key features:

Feature	Description
Temperature (Â°C)	Current temperature
Humidity (%)	Moisture content in the air
Wind Speed (km/h)	Speed of the wind
Precipitation (%)	Rainfall probability
Cloud Cover	Sky condition (Clear, Cloudy, Overcast)
Atmospheric Pressure	Pressure at sea level
UV Index	Intensity of ultraviolet radiation
Season	Season during observation (Spring, Winter)
Visibility (km)	Visibility range
Location Type	Geographic type (Inland, Coastal, Mountain)
Target	Weather Type (Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy)
